								<h1>The Problem</h1>
								<p>
									The University of Southern California (USC) is amongst one of the most culturally diverse universities across the world. It is surrounded by Los Angeles which, as a city, is a constellation of unique experiences. However, USC students still rely heavily on friends’ suggestions when it comes to classes to enroll in, restaurants to eat at, and places to explore.
								</p>
								<p>
									The limitation of such a pool of knowledge is how large and knowledgeable your peer group is. Valuable advice is usually isolated to each individual group and information sharing is currently a very fragmented experience. People use Yelp for restaurants, RottenTomatoes for movies, RateMyProfessor for professors, TripAdvisor for travelling, and anecdotes for experiences. This is the problem that KnowItAll is aimed to solve.

							<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
							<div class="col-lg-10">
								<h1>User Requirements</h1>
								<p>
									Working with the stakeholders, it was clear that the product had 3 types of users: an admin user, a USC user, and a general user.
								</p>
								<p>
									A <b>General User</b> is someone who visits the site for its content but cannot/does not create an account.
									<ol type="I">
										<li>
											As a general user, I would like to search for different entities and view their results.
										</li>
										<li>
											As a general user, I do not have privileges to respond or comment on polls, questions, and reviews.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<p>
									A <b>USC User</b> is someone with a valid USC email who creates an account and has all the features of a general user.
									<ol type="I">
										<li>
											As a USC user, I would like to create, respond, and comment on any polls, questions and reviews.
										</li>
										<li>
											As a USC user, I would like to create polls and questions that are time-sensitive (expires after a certain amount of time).
										</li>
										<li>
											As a USC user, I would like the option to be anonymous.
										</li>
										<li>
											As a USC user, I would like to connect with friends to see their activity.
										</li>
										<li>
											As a USC user, I would like to chat with friends to see their activity.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<p>
									An <b>Admin User</b> has all the features of a USC user with elevated administrative options (this is the stakeholder).
									<ol type="I">
										<li>
											As an admin user, I want a control panel to view all users, posts, and requests.
										</li>
										<li>
											As an admin user, I want to be able to delete and edit users, posts, and requests.
										</li>
										<li>
											As an admin user, I want a dashboard that summarizes my site's usage rate and performance metrics.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-1"></div>
						</div>

						<div id="knowItAllTheSolution" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							<h1>The Solution</h1>
							<p>
								The platform allows students to ask questions and have them be easily answered by credible and reliable colleagues. Additionally, students also have the ability to vote on which questions, reviews, polls, or memes are the most popular within the past day, week, or month. This makes it easy for people to discover what is most common amongst the student community.
							</p>
							<p>
								KnowItAll’s architectural design is detailed using the Three-Tiered design pattern as well as the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. The Three-Tiered Design breaks down into the system’s presentation layer, business logic, and database layer. The MVC pattern describes the web and database layers in three interconnected parts. The architectural design lays the foundations for how our detailed design will be structured. (refer to Design Document for more info)
							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="knowItAllLearned" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							<h1>What I Learned</h1>
							<p>
								As a product manager, I learned how to work closely with stakeholders to understand what users really want. I prioritized features that were right for users instead of ones that were easy to implement. I also learned how to create full documentations: High Level Document, Design Document, and Implementation Document. I used Trello to manage our sprint tasks and spearheaded the project through 7 sprints under an agile environment. After critical client meetings where major requirements changed, I learned how to pivot the team in a new direction so that we were still on time to finish the project.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a software lead, I helped teach the rest of the team about React, Redux, and Git. I also learned how to effectively whitebox and blackbox test web applications using Chai and Selenium (refer to testing document). Learning how to incorporate testing into an interative development process was challenging because I had to find ways to optimize and streamline the process. I created a system within the team were Pull Requests had to be reviewed and tested by at least 2 team members before anything was merged. This helped the team learn how to not only use Git in a team environment, but also how to test other people's code.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="knowItAllNext" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							<h1>What's Next</h1>
							<p>
								At the end of the project, we shipped the end product by giving our stakeholders all the documentation as well as access to the codebase. While this ultimately was a class project, we definitely took it beyond the scopes of what the class asked for. The final product was polished and even user tested amongst a sample size of the class. We also deployed the project using Heroku. The next steps if my team were to explore this opportunity again would definitely be figuring out how to monetize such an "all in one" system.

								 <h1>The Problem</h1>
								 <p>
									 The University of Southern California (USC) is amongst one of the most culturally diverse universities across the world. It is surrounded by Los Angeles which, as a city, is a constellation of unique experiences. However, USC students still rely heavily on friends’ suggestions when it comes to classes to enroll in, restaurants to eat at, and places to explore.
								 </p>
								 <p>
									 The limitation of such a pool of knowledge is how large and knowledgeable your peer group is. Valuable advice is usually isolated to each individual group and information sharing is currently a very fragmented experience. People use Yelp for restaurants, RottenTomatoes for movies, RateMyProfessor for professors, TripAdvisor for travelling, and anecdotes for experiences. This is the problem that KnowItAll is aimed to solve.

								 <h1>User Requirements</h1>
								 <p>
									 Working with the stakeholders, it was clear that the product had 3 types of users: an admin user, a USC user, and a general user.
								 </p>
								 <p>
									 A <b>General User</b> is someone who visits the site for its content but cannot/does not create an account.
									 <ol type="I">
										 <li>
											 As a general user, I would like to search for different entities and view their results.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As a general user, I do not have privileges to respond or comment on polls, questions, and reviews.
										 </li>
									 </ol>
								 </p>

								 <p>
									 A <b>USC User</b> is someone with a valid USC email who creates an account and has all the features of a general user.
									 <ol type="I">
										 <li>
											 As a USC user, I would like to create, respond, and comment on any polls, questions and reviews.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As a USC user, I would like to create polls and questions that are time-sensitive (expires after a certain amount of time).
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As a USC user, I would like the option to be anonymous.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As a USC user, I would like to connect with friends to see their activity.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As a USC user, I would like to chat with friends to see their activity.
										 </li>
									 </ol>
								 </p>

								 <p>
									 An <b>Admin User</b> has all the features of a USC user with elevated administrative options (this is the stakeholder).
									 <ol type="I">
										 <li>
											 As an admin user, I want a control panel to view all users, posts, and requests.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As an admin user, I want to be able to delete and edit users, posts, and requests.
										 </li>
										 <li>
											 As an admin user, I want a dashboard that summarizes my site's usage rate and performance metrics.
										 </li>
									 </ol>

						 <div id="knowItAllTheSolution" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							 <h1>The Solution</h1>
							 <p>
								 The platform allows students to ask questions and have them be easily answered by credible and reliable colleagues. Additionally, students also have the ability to vote on which questions, reviews, polls, or memes are the most popular within the past day, week, or month. This makes it easy for people to discover what is most common amongst the student community.
							 </p>
							 <p>
								 KnowItAll’s architectural design is detailed using the Three-Tiered design pattern as well as the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. The Three-Tiered Design breaks down into the system’s presentation layer, business logic, and database layer. The MVC pattern describes the web and database layers in three interconnected parts. The architectural design lays the foundations for how our detailed design will be structured. (refer to Design Document for more info)
							 </p>
						 </div>

						 <div id="knowItAllLearned" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							 <h1>What I Learned</h1>
							 <p>
								 As a product manager, I learned how to work closely with stakeholders to understand what users really want. I prioritized features that were right for users instead of ones that were easy to implement. I also learned how to create full documentations: High Level Document, Design Document, and Implementation Document. I used Trello to manage our sprint tasks and spearheaded the project through 7 sprints under an agile environment. After critical client meetings where major requirements changed, I learned how to pivot the team in a new direction so that we were still on time to finish the project.
							 </p>
							 <p>
								 As a software lead, I helped teach the rest of the team about React, Redux, and Git. I also learned how to effectively whitebox and blackbox test web applications using Chai and Selenium (refer to testing document). Learning how to incorporate testing into an interative development process was challenging because I had to find ways to optimize and streamline the process. I created a system within the team were Pull Requests had to be reviewed and tested by at least 2 team members before anything was merged. This helped the team learn how to not only use Git in a team environment, but also how to test other people's code.
							 </p>
						 </div>

						 <div id="knowItAllNext" class="animate-box modal-content-container row">
							 <h1>What's Next</h1>
							 <p>
								 At the end of the project, we shipped the end product by giving our stakeholders all the documentation as well as access to the codebase. While this ultimately was a class project, we definitely took it beyond the scopes of what the class asked for. The final product was polished and even user tested amongst a sample size of the class. We also deployed the project using Heroku. The next steps if my team were to explore this opportunity again would definitely be figuring out how to monetize such an "all in one" system.
